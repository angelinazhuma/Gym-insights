# Fitness Insights: Analyzing Exercise Patterns and Performance Across Experience Levels
Team members:
- Angelina Zhumadilova
## Project Motivation and Goals
Understanding how gym users at different levels of experience (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) behave during their workouts provides valuable insights for:
- Gym Trainers: To create fitness plans tailored to specific skill levels.
- Gyms: To allocate resources such as equipment based on member preferences.
- Fitness App Developers: To improve personalization algorithms for better user experiences.
## Project Goals
- Data Cleaning: Standardize and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Create compelling visualizations to explore trends, identify workout patterns, and highlight key differences across experience levels.
- Classification Model: Develop a machine learning model to predict a gym member's experience level.
- Regression Model: Build a predictive model to estimate calories burned during workouts.
- Reccomendations & Insights: Analyze the findings to provide actionable recommendations for optimizing gym operations, tailoring fitness plans, and improving fitness app personalization.
